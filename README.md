# PhishGuard AI

PhishGuard AI is an adaptive phishing training platform built with Django, React, and scikit-learn.

It helps users learn how to identify phishing emails through baseline assessments, guided practice, personalized recommendations, and ML-based skill progression.

---

## Why this project exists

Most phishing training is static. Real users are not.

PhishGuard AI adapts to each user by tracking accuracy, response time, and behavior consistency. It then adjusts difficulty and recommendations so users improve faster on the areas where they struggle.

---

## Project Objectives Coverage

1. Develop a phishing awareness training system using simulated email scenarios.  
   - Implemented through scenario-based quiz and practice modules backed by `PhishingScenario` records.
2. Analyze user responses to evaluate phishing detection capability.  
   - Implemented through per-attempt tracking plus dashboard metrics (phishing recall, false positive/negative rates, capability score).
3. Classify users based on performance using machine learning techniques.  
   - Implemented using a RandomForest skill classifier (`beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`).
4. Dynamically adjust scenario difficulty according to user learning progress.  
   - Implemented via adaptive next-difficulty selection using skill level + recent performance trend.
5. Enhance user awareness and reduce susceptibility to phishing attacks.  
   - Implemented through immediate indicator feedback, personalized recommendations, and continuous practice workflow.

## Kaggle Dataset Integration

This project is trained with the exact datasets below:

1. Phishing Email Dataset  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset

2. Enron Email Dataset  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset

### What is used from the datasets

- Phishing corpus (`phishing_email.csv`) and Enron corpus (`emails.csv`) are loaded and normalized.
- Email-level features are extracted (urgency, suspicious links, attachment signals, grammar noise, caps ratio, length, etc.).
- A benchmark classifier is run to verify signal quality.
- Feature distributions are used to generate realistic behavior patterns for skill + anomaly model training.

A training quality report is written to:

`ml_engine/saved_models/training_report.json`

## Retrain models with Kaggle data

Make sure datasets are in `datasets/` and run:

```bash
source phishenv/bin/activate
python manage.py retrain_models --kaggle
```

This updates:
- `ml_engine/saved_models/rf_skill.pkl`
- `ml_engine/saved_models/iso_forest.pkl`
- `ml_engine/saved_models/training_report.json`
